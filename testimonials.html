            <p>
            By far one of the best massages I've received. Knew exactly what was causing the tension and knots, as well as how to fix them. Going to get a massage is hit or miss these days. This was definitely a hit. Noticed a substantial increase in general mobility the following day, and significantly less tension. Elvis is personable, professional and does a damn good job at what he does. I'd recommend him to anyone, anyday.</p>

            <p>Elvis came to the Rutgers Health Fair today on the Newark campus and generously shared his talent with the staff, giving me one of the most sincere and comprehensive chair massages I've ever had. He honed in on every pocket of tension and went after each relentlessly, resulting in releases of energy that felt like shooting stars rocketing through my body. I feel WONDERFUL. Thank you, Elvis!</p>

            <h2>Tomekii Holder</h2>
            <p>This was the best deep tissue massage I've ever received. I have problem with swelling in one of my ankles due to a bad sprain that the doctors have said I have to learn live with. After the massage, I notice the swelling wasn't as bad. I definitely plan to be a return customer.</p>

            <p>If you haven't had a massage from Elvis before, you are missing out on a 5-star massage! I've been to different places, but all the things that make a massage good were present. Good atmosphere, relaxing unique music selection, excellent flow from the the right body part to right body part, good pressure at the right locations, and the ability to recognize what areas next extra attention. Obviously, I'll be returning for a follow up.</p>

            <p>"Beautiful" is all I can say. Elvis has amazing hands and the way he massaged...I could tell he is a "Feeler". I suffer with Fibromyalgia and I had mentioned ONLY about my Flared up spots. As he was massaging he would massage MORE in other spots that were painful as well. He FEELS people's pain and truly wants to help. There are not many massage therapist who feel people's pain. I am so lucky to have found Elvis. He did not rush even for one MOMENT. I will give Elvis FIVE STARS. I LOVED his massage. Thank you ELVIS</p>
